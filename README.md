# Raspduino-Car
Car made by Raspberry Pi and Arduino

This is a repository in which I'll upload the source code of my first project.

Teachers of my institute asked me to develop a project related to engineering. I was very interested in areas related to the robotic and I was learning to program and use Raspberry Pi so I decided to make a Wi-Fi controlled Car. My first steps were with Raspberry Pi and later I decided to develop the control part of my project with Arduino. Here you have the source code of my project.
